## Introduction

The project consists of using data taken from an external API and displaying it on the screen.
In this case the data taken are random cocktails, with a specific recipe.
The site also offers the possibility of having the recipe, as well as in the original language, also in Italian and German.


## Structure

The structure of the project is:
index.html: contains the backbone of the project, in which the style sheet (CSS) for the graphics of ''Random Cocktails'' and the script for the functions are inserted.
styles.css: the style sheet with which I created the style and graphics.
script.js: script used to create the various HTML elements and the functions of the various buttons present.


## Technology used

I used several technologies to create this project:
Visual Studio Code, as an editor for writing code.
HTML, to create the container for the image.
CSS played a crucial role in providing the project with an aesthetic appearance and ensuring responsiveness through Media Queries.
Finally, JavaScript, the chosen programming language, was used to implement the various features.


## Usability

The use of the ''Random Cocktails'' site is really simple and intuitive, through the ''Get Random'' button you will get the recipe for a random cocktail as a result.
You can then read the recipe either in the original language, or, optionally, in Italian or German.
